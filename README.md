# Particle-Swarm-Optimization

In this project, PSO Algorithm MATLAB code is provided and TSP which is a NP-hard problem is been modeled and optimized by PSO algorithm.

(PSO algorithm):

On the one hand, this algorithm is related to artificial life, especially group theories, and on the other hand,
to evolutionary processing algorithms, and in particular to evolutionary strategy, which is inspired by the collective behavior
of fish or birds to find food. A group of birds or fish are looking for food in a random space and there is only one piece of food and none
of the birds knows the location of the food and only knows their distance from the food. One of the best strategies is to follow a bird that is closer to food.
